This directory contains the Inverse Reinforcement Learning algorithms used in the experiemnts. 

In particular, we have a folder with the Preferential Trajectory-based Inverse Reinforcement Learning (PTIRL) algorithm, and another folder
CURRENT_IRL with the Maxent and Adversarial IRL (AIRL) algorithms. 

The PTIRL algorithm requires specialized software such as CPLEX and Barron,and for the Maxenrt and AIRL, recent versions of python (3.8+), might
be required to successfully run these. 

Also, refer to the original github link for the Maxent and AIRL algorithms:https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/imitation
